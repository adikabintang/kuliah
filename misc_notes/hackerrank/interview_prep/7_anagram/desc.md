Complete the makeAnagram function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the minimum total characters that must be deleted to make the strings anagrams.

For example, if a = cde and b = dcf, we can delete e from string a and f from string b so that both remaining strings are cd and dc which are anagrams.
