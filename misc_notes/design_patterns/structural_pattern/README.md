# Adapter Pattern
Adapter pattern allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another. For example, if there are two applications, one spits output as XML and another requires JSON input, then we'll need an adapter between the two to make them work seamlessly.

## Intent
- Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
- Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
- The adapter could also be thought of as a "wrapper".
- Impedance match an old component to a new system.
