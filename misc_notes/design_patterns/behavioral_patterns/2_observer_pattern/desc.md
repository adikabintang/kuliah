This is a note taken from here: https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer 

# Observer design pattern
## Intent
- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that **when one object changes states, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically**.
- Encapsulate the core components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable components in an Observer hierarchy.
- The "View" part of Model-View-Controller.
