I get the Bootstrap from here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
I put the css bootstrap for testing purpose. It's not for redistribution. I need to test HTTP2 server push with a somewhat large css file. That's why I put it here.
I believe the MIT license permits this: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/about/license/
