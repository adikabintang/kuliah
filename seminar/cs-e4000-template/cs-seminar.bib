%Digital twin is a new concept of using digital replicas/representation for %managing physical assets, components, processes, machines, etc. In this %topic, we should study digital twin and its application for industrial %machines: how digital twin can be used to model industrial machines in the %edge. The study can focus on a subset of the following important questions %for this study:

%- What does it mean digital twin for industrial machines?

%- How can we  use concepts of digital twin for managing industrial machines at the edge?

%- Which tools and frameworks can be used for developing digital twin for industrial machines?

%- What are the roles of IoT, containers and service models/APIs for implementing digital twin solutions?

%- How can we connect digital twin for industrial machines to the cloud services?
